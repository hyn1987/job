    <h3>Part Evolution</h3>
    <p>
    Our story begins with two leading pioneers in online work: Elance and oDesk. Each had created thriving global communities with separate paths to success. In 2014 we realized that we could do more together and merged to form Elance-oDesk, combining ideas, technology and resources.
    </p>
    <h3>Part Revolution</h3>
    <p>As we formed a shared vision, we saw that our impact would be even greater if we focused on building one great workplace. With the oDesk platform as the foundation, we kept the best of both legacies and added new innovations. In 2015 we re-launched the company as Upwork, representing a renewed vision and commitment to creating the world’s best online workplace – for existing and future customers alike.</p>
    <h3>Creating opportunity and freedom</h3>
    <p>Today, Upwork is the premier platform for top companies to hire and work with the world’s most talented independent professionals. We’re creating a world of unmatched talent and opportunity, where global teammates who are thousands of miles apart can work together seamlessly.</p>',
